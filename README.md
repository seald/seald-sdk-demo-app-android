# Seald SDK demo app Android

This is a basic app, demonstrating use of the Seald SDK for Android.

You can check the reference documentation at <https://docs.seald.io/sdk/seald-sdk-android/>.

The main file you could be interested in reading is [`./app/src/main/java/io/seald/seald_sdk_demo_app_android/MainActivity.kt`](./app/src/main/java/io/seald/seald_sdk_demo_app_android/MainActivity.kt).

Also, it is recommended to create your own Seald team on <https://www.seald.io/create-sdk>,
and change the values of `appId`, `JWTSharedSecretId`, and `JWTSharedSecret`
at the start of `./app/src/main/java/io/seald/seald_sdk_demo_app_android/MainActivity.kt`,
so that the example runs in your own Seald team.
